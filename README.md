# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

In this project, I have added code that allows for the automatic detection of lane lines using Canny edge detection followed by Hough-transforms.  The code is written in Python 3 and makes use of OpenCV.
## Prerequisites

This code requires Python 3 with Juputer Notebook installed to run.  An Anaconda distribution is recommended, as it includes the necessary modules.

## How to Run

You can run the code by executing the P1.ipynb file.

## Author

John Austin added code to allow the detection of lane lines to a template provided by Udacity.
